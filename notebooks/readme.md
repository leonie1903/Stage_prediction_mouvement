# Inactivity and Activity Detection from Accelerometer Data (InactiviyDetector.ipynb)

## Overview
This project is inspired by GGIR, a widely used R package for processing raw accelerometer data to analyze physical activity and inactivity periods. The implementation in this repository is a Python adaptation that detects inactivity periods, visualizes daily activity patterns, and generates binary classifications of active vs. inactive periods.

## Inspiration & References
This project is heavily inspired by GGIR, an R package developed for physical activity and sleep research. The methodologies implemented here are derived from scientific studies on accelerometer signal processing, particularly:
