# Data

This folder contains supporting data files used for synchronization and activity labeling.

## Synchronization Files
- `0.csv` and `1.csv`: raw data files used for sensor synchronization (wrist-worn accelerometers).

## Activity Logs
- `activityM.csv`: activity log corresponding to the **first week** of recording.
- `activityM2.csv`: activity log corresponding to the **second week** of recording.

These CSV files include time intervals and manually reported activity labels (e.g., eating, dressing, personal care).

## Notice on Accelerometer Data
The original raw accelerometer files are **not included** in this repository due to:
- **File size constraints** (large binary files)
- **Ethical considerations** regarding participant data privacy
